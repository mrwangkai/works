                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Send shortcuts make it easier for customers to quickly send transfers. Currently Remitly had one send shortcut: the "send again" button on completed transfer cards. However, this shortcut was modeled on a transfer-first mindset, while research and analysis showed that Remitly users actually have a recipient-first mindset.</p>
                    <p>The Recipient Quick Send project introduced recipient-focused shortcuts to the Home screen, with the hypothesis that these shortcuts would particularly benefit our most active customers who often have multiple recipients they send to regularly.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>Sending shortcuts to repeat similar transfers were effective, yet they were not modeled and placed in a way customers expected. Analysis revealed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users in the 11+ transfers state represented a <strong>$7.34M/quarter profit opportunity gap</strong> between average and top quartile profitability</li>
                        <li><strong>88% of top quartile users</strong> with 11+ transfers had more than 1 recipient (76% had >2, 64% had >3)</li>
                        <li>Research showed customers' mental model for sending was <strong>centered on recipients</strong>, not transfers or corridors</li>
                        <li>While 52% of users queued transfers to the same recipient, <strong>only 26% used 'Send Again'</strong> - especially pronounced with frequent senders</li>
                        <li>19% of users queued to recipients that fell outside of recent transfer history (send again not available on home screen)</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase next best action rate (send again) for frequent senders with multiple recipients</li>
                        <li>Improve send again order rate when no transfers are in flight, especially for Nth - No Active Txn (11+ txn) state customers</li>
                        <li>Match customers' recipient-first mental model for sending</li>
                        <li>Capture potential repeat transfers that fall outside of available transfer cards on the home screen</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <h3>Discovery & Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Analyzed next best action rates across customer states and sending behavior to identify opportunities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conducted behavioral analysis showing that frequent senders (11+ transfers) had multiple recipients, yet 'Send Again' was underutilized</li>
                        <li>Reviewed data showing 52% of users queued transfers to the same recipient, but only 26% used 'Send Again'</li>
                        <li>Identified $7.34M/quarter profit opportunity gap for frequent senders</li>
                        <li>Validated through research that customers' mental model for sending is centered on recipients, not transfers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Design & Testing Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Developed a multi-treatment experiment to test recipient-focused shortcuts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Treatment 1:</strong> Recipient shortcuts shown above transfer cards</li>
                        <li><strong>Treatment 2:</strong> Recipient shortcuts shown below transfer cards</li>
                        <li><strong>Treatment 3:</strong> Recipient shortcuts shown above transfer cards with reduced transfer card count</li>
                        <li>Horizontal orientation to maximize recipients shown without excessive vertical space</li>
                        <li>Recipients ranked by most recent successful send, prioritizing current corridor</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Validation</h3>
                    <p>Ran a 14-day A/B test across app and web with multiple treatments, measuring revenue per user, order rate, and completion rate. Treatment 3 emerged as the winning variant.</p>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>The final design (Treatment 3) featured recipient-focused shortcuts prominently placed on the Home screen:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recipient Quick Send Section:</strong> Horizontally scrollable list showing up to 10 recent recipients, ranked by most recent successful send</li>
                        <li><strong>Recipient Cards:</strong> Each card displays recipient initials, name, delivery method, and last sent date</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Placement:</strong> Positioned above transfer cards when no active transfers, with only 1 inactive transfer card shown to maximize Quick Send visibility</li>
                        <li><strong>Smart Pre-population:</strong> Clicking a recipient opens send flow with all details from last transfer (recipient info, corridor, send amount, delivery method, payment method)</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-corridor Support (Web):</strong> Recipients from other corridors shown with country flag indicator, enabling seamless corridor switching</li>
                        <li><strong>"Send to New Recipient" option:</strong> Quick access to add new recipients without leaving the home screen</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Treatment 3 (recipient shortcuts above 1 transfer card) showed statistically significant positive results:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>+0.55% profit per user increase</strong> for frequent senders (Nth with 11+ transfers)</li>
                        <li><strong>+0.66% completed transfers per user</strong>, indicating increased sending frequency</li>
                        <li><strong>51.9% feature interaction rate</strong> among exposed users, demonstrating strong adoption</li>
                        <li><strong>$3.4M annualized profit opportunity</strong> from the feature improvement</li>
                        <li>Revenue per user stayed flat or increased across all test segments, validating the hypothesis</li>
                        <li>Strong performance particularly among users with multiple recipients, the primary target segment</li>

                    <h2>Learnings</h2>
                    <p>Key takeaways from this project:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mental models matter:</strong> Aligning features with how users think (recipient-first vs. transfer-first) dramatically improves adoption and effectiveness</li>
                        <li><strong>Small improvements, big impact:</strong> Even modest increases (+0.55% profit per user) can generate millions in annualized value when applied to the right customer segments</li>
                        <li><strong>Placement is critical:</strong> Treatment 3 outperformed others by reducing visual competition‚Äîshowing fewer transfer cards increased Quick Send visibility and usage</li>
                        <li><strong>Test what matters:</strong> Multi-treatment testing revealed that not just the feature, but its positioning relative to existing elements, determined success</li>
                        <li><strong>Data-driven segmentation:</strong> Targeting frequent senders with multiple recipients (88% of top quartile users) ensured we solved for the highest-value use case</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical constraints shape design:</strong> Ranking by most recent send (vs. most frequent) was technically feasible and still delivered strong results, proving that perfect can be the enemy of good</li>
