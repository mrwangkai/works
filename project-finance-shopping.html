                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Financing is a critical part of car buying for many CarMax customers. However, data showed that a significant number of customers who applied for financing with CarMax did not end up completing a purchase—a lower-than-expected app-to-sales conversion rate.</p>
                    <p>This project aimed to understand why financed customers weren't converting and design solutions to improve their shopping and purchasing experience.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>Despite financing being a major part of car buying, customers who applied for financing weren't converting to purchases at expected rates. The challenge was to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand why customers who received financing approval weren't completing purchases</li>
                        <li>Identify friction points in the post-approval shopping experience</li>
                        <li>Determine how to better connect financing offers to vehicle shopping</li>
                        <li>Improve the overall app-to-sales conversion rate</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand the root causes of low app-to-sales conversion for financed customers</li>
                        <li>Improve the connection between financing approval and vehicle shopping</li>
                        <li>Increase conversion rate from financing application to completed purchase</li>
                        <li>Reduce friction in the post-approval experience</li>
                        <li>Design and test solutions in a controlled production environment</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Conducted comprehensive discovery to understand the problem space:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzed quantitative data on financing application and purchase patterns</li>
                        <li>Interviewed customers who applied for financing but didn't complete purchases</li>

                        <li>Sketched multiple concepts for improving post-approval shopping</li>
                        <li>Developed mockups showcasing financing application components</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Prototype Development</h3>
                    <p>Built iterative wireframes and prototypes to test concepts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed consistent car card components for use across multiple platforms</li>
                        <li>Created high-fidelity prototypes showing financing-integrated shopping flows</li>
                        <li>Iterated based on feedback from in-store research and moderated testing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Testing & Validation</h3>
                    <p>Conducted moderated and unmoderated usability tests, then shipped a production-ready test in a controlled environment to validate real-world performance.</p>

                    <h2>Learnings</h2>
                    <p>Key takeaways from this project:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Discovery is essential:</strong> Understanding the root problem through research prevented solving the wrong problem and ensured solutions addressed real customer pain points</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-functional collaboration drives success:</strong> Working closely with sales, operations, and engineering teams ensured designs were feasible and addressed business needs</li>
                        <li><strong>Iterate based on real feedback:</strong> In-store visits and testing with actual customers revealed insights that desk research couldn't uncover</li>
                        <li><strong>Design systems accelerate delivery:</strong> Creating reusable components (like the car card) enabled consistent experiences across platforms and faster future development</li>
                        <li><strong>Test in production when possible:</strong> Real-world testing in controlled environments provides the most accurate validation of design decisions</li>
                        <li><strong>Complex problems require patient, methodical approaches:</strong> Improving conversion requires understanding multiple factors—customer behavior, business processes, and technical constraints</li>
