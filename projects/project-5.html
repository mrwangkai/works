                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Capital One's Small Business Card team needed a strategic tool to ensure new product features directly addressed real customer pain points across the engagement journey. Without a unified understanding of user experiences across sales, underwriting, and small business owner touchpoints, teams risked building features disconnected from actual needs.</p>
                    <p>This service blueprint project mapped the complete customer journey across three user groups—sales, underwriting, and small business owners—to identify experience gaps and align the product roadmap with strategic opportunities.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The Small Business Card product team faced critical alignment challenges:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No shared understanding of the end-to-end customer journey across different user groups</li>
                        <li>Difficulty connecting proposed features to actual customer pain points and experience gaps</li>
                        <li>Lack of a common strategic tool for leadership to communicate roadmap priorities</li>
                        <li>Multiple touchpoints and processes needed to be understood holistically</li>
                        <li>Need for a living artifact that could evolve as experiments shipped and insights emerged</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <h3>Discovery Sessions</h3>
                    <p>Conducted in-depth discovery sessions with three key user groups to understand their experiences, processes, and emotional journeys:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sales teams:</strong> Mapped their workflows, tools, and pain points in customer acquisition</li>
                        <li><strong>Underwriting staff:</strong> Documented approval processes, decision criteria, and operational challenges</li>
                        <li><strong>Small business owners:</strong> Captured application experiences, expectations, and frustrations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Synthesis & Mapping</h3>
                    <p>Translated discovery insights into a comprehensive service blueprint:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Articulated user processes and emotional journeys across touchpoints</li>
                        <li>Grouped events into new categories to reveal patterns and opportunities</li>
                        <li>Identified key moments where experience gaps created friction or drop-off</li>
                        <li>Consulted product leadership to validate findings and prioritize opportunities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Strategic Artifact Creation</h3>
                    <p>Designed the blueprint as a strategic planning tool rather than a static deliverable:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created clear connections between experience gaps and product/feature opportunities</li>
                        <li>Built in flexibility for quarterly updates as experiments shipped</li>
                        <li>Designed for leadership communication and roadmap alignment</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Deliverable</h2>
                    <p>The service blueprint became a foundational strategic tool:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Journey Visualization:</strong> End-to-end view of small business card engagement across all user groups</li>
                        <li><strong>Experience Gap Identification:</strong> Clear documentation of pain points and friction throughout the journey</li>
                        <li><strong>Opportunity Mapping:</strong> Direct connections between gaps and potential features/products</li>
                        <li><strong>Living Artifact:</strong> Quarterly updates tracking experiment impacts and evolving insights</li>
                        <li><strong>Leadership Alignment Tool:</strong> Shared resource for strategy communication and roadmap discussions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strategic clarity:</strong> Created urgency and alignment around product roadmap priorities</li>
                        <li><strong>Evidence-based planning:</strong> Ensured every proposed feature had clear connection to customer pain points</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-functional alignment:</strong> Provided common language and understanding across sales, underwriting, and product teams</li>
                        <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Quarterly updates allowed teams to track experiment outcomes and adjust strategy</li>
                        <li><strong>Leadership communication:</strong> Became the central tool for communicating product strategy and roadmap rationale</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced wasted effort:</strong> Prevented building features disconnected from real user needs</li>

                    <h2>Learnings</h2>
                    <p>Key insights from creating a strategic service blueprint:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Research as strategy:</strong> Service blueprints aren't just documentation—they're strategic tools that drive product decisions and organizational alignment</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple perspectives reveal opportunities:</strong> Mapping journeys across different user groups (sales, underwriting, customers) surfaced gaps no single perspective would catch</li>
                        <li><strong>Make artifacts living documents:</strong> Building in quarterly updates ensured the blueprint remained relevant and reflected evolving insights from shipped experiments</li>
                        <li><strong>Connect features to pain points:</strong> The blueprint's power came from explicitly linking every proposed feature to a documented experience gap</li>
                        <li><strong>Design for your audience:</strong> Leadership needed a communication tool, not just a research deliverable—designing for that use case increased impact</li>
                        <li><strong>Synthesis drives urgency:</strong> Visualizing the complete journey and its gaps created shared urgency that accelerated roadmap alignment</li>
                    </ul>
